# Automox_API_Report_Automation
* Automox offers a reporting UI that is limited in functionality and automation. 
* Automox offers API functionality for organizations to push, pull, or delete devices and their information.
* The API documentation gives basic command examples, which did not meet our organization's needs.
* The community blogs have well thought-out scripts that are beyond the scope of our organization's needs.
* These scripts are simple scripts meant for anyone looking for help with concepts they have little experience with, when running reports using the Automox API:
  * JSON parsing
  * Python dictionaries and lists
  * Automox API
